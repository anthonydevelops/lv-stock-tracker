# LV Stock Tracker

A script built in Typescript to pull online in-stock status of bags.

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run project
npm start index.ts
```

## Why was this built?

Trying to hook up family with a tracker that LV doesn't support.

## What's next?

I'll fix up the project to include a frontend to search by product name or sku using React. Also, I'll need to expand this to be able to track all bags and also switch out my IP so I don't get blocked, which happened quite often.
